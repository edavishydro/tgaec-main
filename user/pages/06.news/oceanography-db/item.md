TGAEC creates an online oceanographic geodatabase. The geolibrary contains decades of oceanography research from the personal collections of Humboldt State University Professor Dr. James Avery Gast and University of Washington Professor Dr. Tommy Thompson. TGAEC scanned the documents, constructed an online searchable geodatabase, and is making the documents available free on request. Most of these documents are historic records and publication available no where else online.
