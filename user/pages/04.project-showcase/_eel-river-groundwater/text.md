<br>

<div> 
The County of Humboldt selected TGAEC’s project team to assess sustainability of groundwater use in the Eel River Valley Basin.  Groundwater in Humboldt County, California, is an important natural resource utilized by 135,000 county residents for residential needs, agricultural irrigation, public supply, and industrial purposes.  The State of California passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) legislation in 2014 which established a framework for sustainable groundwater management throughout the State.  For groundwater basins designated “high or medium priority” by the State Water Board, such as the Eel River Valley, the SGMA requires the development of a groundwater sustainability plan (GSP) containing measures to ensure that the basin is operated within its sustainable yield.  The County of Humboldt (County) is the local public agency tasked with implementing the SGMA. 
<br><br>
As an alternative to developing a groundwater sustainability plan, the SGMA contains provisions allowing the County to submit a report prepared by a registered professional engineer or licensed geologist analyzing basin conditions and demonstrating that the basin has operated within its sustainable yield over a period of at least 10 years.  Sustainable yield is the maximum quantity of water that can be withdrawn annually from a groundwater supply basin without causing an undesirable result such as lowering of groundwater levels and depletion of supply, reduction of groundwater storage, seawater intrusion, degraded water quality, and land subsidence.  
<br><br>
TGAEC’s primary responsibility for this project was to inform the construction of a Water Balance Model for the basin from surface flow measurements taken from multiple locations on both the mainstem Eel and the lower Van Duzen River - an important lower Eel River tributary.  Analysis of surface flow data was identified as a critical piece of the water balance, and Mr. Gast was selected to be responsible for the final siting, design, and implementation of the surface water measurements (Figure 2).  He is also supervising QA/QC of all field data and outputs from the software, and is preparing final reports and figures.
