<div class="h4 text-dark">Cal Trans San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Pier E4 and E5 Marine Foundation Dismantling- Sound Exposure Study (August 2016- October 2016)</div>
<br>

<div> 
The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge (SFOBB), originally constructed in the 1930â€™s, is traversed daily by an average of 280,000 vehicles.  Damage incurred during the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake revealed the critical need for seismic safety on Bay Area bridges, and as a result, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) began instituting seismic upgrades for the Bay Bridge that remain ongoing.  In 2016, Caltrans, as part of the dismantling of the original East Span of the SFOBB, implemented a project for the controlled blasting of the in-water concrete caissons supporting Piers E4 and E5.  
<br><br>
In order to monitor for potential adverse impacts to Federal and state-listed endangered fish species arising from high intensity sound associated with the blasting, Caltrans and its contractors developed a hydroacoustic monitoring and caged fish study plan.  Fish were held in floating pens adjacent to the demolition work and were subjected to ambient conditions during the implosion event.  Subsequently, necropsies were performed on all fish to determine the extent, if any, of damage caused by exposure to the high intensity sound waves.  As a member of the project team tasked with carrying out the sound exposure study, TGAEC provided two boats and boat operators for the deployment and retrieval of the floating fish cages, and participated in conducting the post-implosion fish surgeries (necropsies) and fish-condition assessments.
