Non-Natal Habitat Enhancement for ESA-Listed Salmonids in the Humboldt Bay Watershed (2016-ongoing)
</div>

<br>

<div> 
In fall 2015 following collaborative discussions with local California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) scientists, TGAEC identified a need for a prioritized restoration strategy for anadromous accessible habitats in Humboldt Bay.  Over 90% of historical tidally-influenced tributary habitat has been lost since the late 19th century, primarily due to levee construction and agricultural development in the area.  CDFW investigations over the past 12-15 years have documented that non-natal rearing of salmonids and other fish species is widespread in Humboldt Bay tributaries where there is a source population that can gain access. Availability (or lack thereof) of suitable rearing habitats can affect fish year-round.   
<br><br>
In 2015-2016, TGAEC joined forces with local non-profit restoration specialists Pacific Coast Fish, Wildlife, and Wetlands Restoration Association (PCFWWRA), and met with other fisheries professionals to develop project objectives and submit a proposal to CDFW’s 2016-2017 “Watershed Restoration and Ecosystem Restoration Grant Program”, funded by Proposition 1.  In December 2016, our CDFW grant proposal resulted in a funding award for PCFWWRA to implement this project in early summer 2017.  
<br><br>
Our project will address the relative lack of non-natal rearing habitats in the lower reaches of anadromous tributaries to Humboldt Bay.  TGAEC will identify, assess, and prioritize specific sites in Humboldt Bay tributaries, with a focus on the stream-estuary ecotones for restoration projects that will not only benefit ESA-listed rearing juvenile salmonids, but also other ESA-listed fish species such as tidewater goby and long fin smelt.  Project deliverables will include conceptual design plans for the five highest priority restoration opportunities, as well as an overall list of identified sites that would benefit from restoration activities.
