Carmel River Reroute & San Clemente Dam Removal - Fish Relocation (2016)
</div>

<br>

<div> 
The Carmel River Reroute & San Clemente Dam Removal (CRRDR) Project is the culmination of a long-term comprehensive effort to improve access for ESA-listed threatened steelhead populations to upstream spawning and rearing habitats, enhance sediment transport to the lower river and Carmel River beach, support ecological continuity of aquatic and riparian habitats through the project reach, and resolve public safety issues associated with San Clemente Dam.  The CRRDR represents the largest dam removal project in California to date.  The San Clemente Dam was removed from the Carmel River in the summer of 2015 after two years of construction work to reroute the river, relocate the reservoir sediments, and prepare the site for its new life without the dam or reservoir.  Remaining work on the site includes habitat restoration and removal of a smaller, obsolete dam located downstream of the project site.

Granite Construction was the selected Design-Build construction contractor responsible for implementing the project and retained Cardno-Entrix as the primary contractor to oversee fish relocation during in-stream habitat restoration work in 2016.  TGAEC was a subcontractor to a DVBE subcontractor Douglas Parkinson & Associates on this project and conducted backpack electrofishing on a 3000-ft reach of the Carmel River where it flows through the former San Clemente Dam site.  Electrofishing was conducted to remove ESA-listed South Central California Coast steelhead and other fish from the project reach in advance of de-watering for in-channel construction/restoration activities.  All captured fish were subsequently relocated to the Carmel River downstream of the CRRDR project area.
