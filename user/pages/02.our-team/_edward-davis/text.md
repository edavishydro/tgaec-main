Mr. Davis completed his B.S. degree in Geology with a Minor in Watershed Management at Humboldt State University in 2019. During the final year of his studies, he took part in an interdisciplinary and cross-cultural project focused on the water resources and ecohydrology of a unique grassland watershed in the Peruvian Andes. As part of this work, he developed a broad range of skills, including conceptual and numerical hydrological modeling, collecting and processing remote sensing data, and designing, conducting, and analyzing geophysical surveys. The project culminated in a month-long field excursion to Peru, where his expertise was put to the test at an elevation of 14,000 feet. In addition to his experience in Peru, he has also taken part in over 120 geomorphic stream surveys across Northern California over two summer seasons with the HSU River Institute. His primary scientific interests are in hydrology and geomorphology at both reach- and catchment-scale, and he is proficient in both data analysis and fieldwork.
