Mr. Voight has been a professional fisheries biologist for over 17 years representing Tribal and private entities within northern California. Mr. Voight earned his undergraduate degree from, and completed master’s level coursework at Humboldt State University, in Arcata, CA. He is well-versed in the ecology of Pacific salmonids, as well as in the multitude of environmental issues facing these fish populations in freshwater and estuarine habitats in California and the Pacific Northwest. Mr. Voight possesses “hands-on” familiarity with most freshwater fisheries field sampling techniques, having supervised and/or participated in many different studies located in Northern California watersheds. As both a senior level Tribal biologist, and as a private consultant, Mr. Voight has written numerous environmental and biological documents, notably, ten Biological Assessments (E.S.A. section 7 consultations), and a comprehensive anadromous fish restoration plan for the lower Smith River, CA. He has also presented scientific findings to, and organized public meetings for both small and large groups from diverse backgrounds. Mr. Voight has led multiple field studies investigating freshwater/estuarine salmonid ecology and biology (fry emergence, rearing, emigration, through adult spawning/migration), assessed habitat requirements for each species and life phase utilizing fresh water, assessed Klamath tributaries upstream of Iron Gate dam for steelhead re-introduction suitability, implemented adult and juvenile salmonid telemetry projects, conducted genetic studies of steelhead hybridizing with coastal cutthroat, and reviewed fisheries restoration grant proposals for four years as a member on the Citizens Peer Review Committee for CDFW’s FRG program.
