Mr. Gast formed Thomas Gast & Associates Environmental Consultants (TGAEC) after working for four years at Normandeau Associates as a Senior Scientist and 14 years at Thomas R. Payne and Associates. Mr. Gast received a B.A. in Marine Resource Management from the University of California at Santa Cruz in 1988 and has worked on and led numerous freshwater fisheries and marine biology field crews in rigorous environments such as Antarctica, the Bering Sea, Yukon Territory, the High Sierras, and Sacramento San Joaquin Delta over the last 27 years. Mr. Gast is particularly adept at implementing complex studies that require intricate logistics to provide innovative solutions. Mr. Gast has had training in IFIM implementation; PHABSIM, SEFA, and RHABSIM analysis, and has been involved with all aspects of instream flow studies including study design, stakeholder meetings, field data collection, data analysis, interpretation, report writing, time series analysis, impact analysis, and results presentation. Mr. Gast has worked extensively with the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) collecting flow measurements and PHABSIM data, as well as developing several methods of deployments in challenging habitat types including shallow turbulent transects. Mr. Gast has collected ADCP data for numerous instream flow projects and has traveled to the eastern U.S and northern Canada with the ADCP. Mr. Gast is a licensed captain through the USCG, utilizing that capacity to implement instream flow, fish tracking, and monitoring studies on both large and small rivers. Mr. Gast has also implemented fisheries and water quality monitoring studies utilizing multiple detection techniques such as direct observation, electrofishing, netting, and trapping as well as installing and maintaining data loggers and transmitters.
