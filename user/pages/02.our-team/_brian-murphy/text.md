Mr. Murphy received his B.S. degree in Environmental Science and Management with an emphasis in Geospatial Analysis in 2019 from Humboldt State University. He uses his skill set of coding, GIS, and design to produce maps, websites, and graphics that can encourage community awareness of environmental issues. He has won multiple cartographic awards for his geographic data visualizations, most notably the 2018 NACIS (North American Cartographic Information Society) conference award for best student research poster for his poster about mountain top removal coal mining. He also was the winner of the 2019 CGS (California Geographic Society) conference second place digital map award for his interactive website mapping Californiaâ€™s watersheds. In addition to his cartographic work, Mr. Murphy has an extensive background in GIS with a focus on remote sensing, and modeling both natural phenomena and human infrastructure. He has published several scientific research papers, including an analysis of dune movement on the north spit of the Humboldt Bay, and modeling of erosion and heavy metal pollution in watersheds that have been subject to strip mining. Mr. Murphy has presented his work at multiple academic conferences across the United States.
