Dr. Bosch is a marine invertebrate biologist and Lake Ecologist with considerable experience working in the marine environment as well as lakes and streams and SCUBA diving in Antarctica, California, the Caribbean and the Mediterranean. He has published 25 papers in peer-reviewed journals and completed more than a dozen technical reports on various aspects of lake ecology and watershed management. At SUNY Geneseo, Dr. Bosch teaches courses in Invertebrate Zoology, Marine and Freshwater Community/Ecosystem Ecology, Principles of Ecology, General Biology and more. He has received various awards for teaching, mentoring and research and obtained competitive grants from the NSF to study the effects of ozone depletion on marine invertebrate larvae in Antarctica and from the USDA and other funding agencies to study the effects of watershed management on growth of algae, macrophytes and cyanobacteria in temperate lakes. His current research is on the cyanobacteria microbiome that occurs in association with sea star larvae in the open ocean, and on the effects of partial mixing of the lake water column in triggering the onset of cyanobacterial blooms in shallow lakes.
Dr. Isidro Bosch obtained his Bachelorâ€™s degree in Aquatic Biology from the University of California at Santa Barbara in 1981 and his Ph.D. in Biology from U.C. Santa Cruz in 1989. In 1992 Dr. Bosch joined the biology faculty at the State University of New York College at Geneseo, where he is currently a full Professor.
